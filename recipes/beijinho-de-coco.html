    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 14oz can of sweet condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut</li>
        <li> tablespoon of butter plus a little more for your hands</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>16 whole cloves for decorating <span style="color: rgb(160, 160, 160);">optional</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the condensed milk, the butter, and the cream to a medium sauce pan and place it over medium heat until the butter melts.</li>
        <li>After the butter has melted, add half of the shredded coconut (1/2 cup) to the pan and stir.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook over medium heat, for approximately 10 mins, stirring repeatedly, scraping the sides and the bottom of the pan with a spatula to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>The beijinho is ready when you scrape the bottom of the pan, and the mixture takes 2-3 seconds to come back to its place, or when the mixture reaches 210F-220F – You can use a candy thermometer, or just a regular food thermometer to check.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot coconut mixture into a dish, or plate, cover with plastic wrap to contact and let it cool – about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour the remaining shredded coconut in a deep plate or bowl.</li>
        <li>When the beijinho mixture has cooled, butter your hands, and scoop 1/2 Tbsp to Tbsp portions and roll little balls.</li>
        <li>Roll the little balls in the shredded coconut, and insert a whole clove to each little coconut ball to decorate, if desired. </li>
        <li>Keep them in a cool place or in the refrigerator until serving time.</li>
    </ol>
